<p class="describe-text">  Hi! Welcome to my profile! </p>
<br>

I am Vishwas, a seasoned data professional passionate about working with engagements driven to make effective use of data; building platforms to cater to the first ideas around ingesting and capturing data accurately, through analysis and modeling and all the way to building products, insights and stories. 

I hold a Masterâ€™s degree in Manufacturing and Systems Engineering specializing in Operations research and Applied statistics from BITS Pilani. 

With **12+ years of experience**, I have worked through different roles in my career: 

- Started as a data scientist with **Caterpillar R&D** working with telemetry data, building ML models to enable decisions across vehicle applications, durability, reliability and more.

- Lead data scientist with **Tiger Analytics** spearheading data science engagements across US, working through various flavors of ML usecases across Marketing, Association modeling, product affinity, segmentation and opimization, 

- Head of data platform (Data Science, Data Engineering, Data and ML ops) building the data suite ground up at **Ather Energy** (an IOT 2 wheeler company). At Ather Energy, I worked closely with the product teams to create a unique product for Ather Customers - "Ather Labs" that enables the developers to put experimental and interesting features rapidly to customers' hands driving towards smarter and intelligent mobility! Built the roadmap of smarter features for the data platform team.

- I currently work with **Tiger Analytics** as a Director managing some of the top Fortune 500 engagements for Data solutions.
